# Deploy, Mint ERC20 Token

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case.

Token Deployment: A streamlined script that allows for the deployment of a fully configurable ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.

Token Minting: Integrated functionality to mint additional tokens post-deployment, offering flexibility in the token's supply.

Vesting: A dedicated contract ensuring structured and phased token releases, promoting stability and fair distribution.

Tests: Rigorous testing using test token.js to ensure every function operates securely and as expected.
